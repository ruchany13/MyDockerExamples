                    <p>NGINX is a well known open source project originally written by Igor Sysoev, a Russian engineer. Igor started the project in 2002 and made it public in 2004. 
                        Since that time NGINX has become a defacto standard for highperformance, scalable websites. Tens of millions of active websites use NGINX, including 1 million busiest websites in the world. 
                        Companies like Airbnb, Box, Dropbox, Netflix, Tumblr, WordPress.com, and many others deploy NGINX for scalability and performance reasons.

                            Nginx is built to offer low memory usage and high concurrency. Rather than creating new processes for each web request, Nginx uses an asynchronous, 
                            event-driven approach where requests are handled in a single thread.
                            With Nginx, one master process can control multiple worker processes. The master maintains the worker processes, while the workers do the actual processing. 
                            Because Nginx is asynchronous, each request can be executed by the worker concurrently without blocking other requests.

                        <p>Apache is another popular open-source web server. In terms of raw numbers, Apache is the most popular web server in existence and is
                            used by 43.6% (down from 47% in 2018) of all websites with a known web server, according to W3Techs. Nginx comes in a close second at 41.8%.
                            Netcraft ran a survey across 233 million domains and found Apache usage at 31.54% and Nginx usage at 26.20%.</p>
