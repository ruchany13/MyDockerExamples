                    <p>The word "Docker" refers to several things, including an open source community project; tools from the open source project; Docker Inc., 
                        the company that primarily supports that project; and the tools that company formally supports. The fact that the technologies and 
                        the company share the same name can be confusing.

                        The Docker technology uses the Linux kernel and features of the kernel, like Cgroups and namespaces, to segregate processes so they can run independently. This independence is the intention of containers—the ability to run multiple processes and apps separately from one another to make better use of your infrastructure while retaining the security you would have with separate systems.

Container tools, including Docker, provide an image-based deployment model. This makes it easy to share an application, or set of services, with all of their dependencies across multiple environments. Docker also automates deploying the application (or combined sets of processes that make up an app) inside this container environment.

These tools built on top of Linux containers—what makes Docker user-friendly and unique—gives users unprecedented access to apps, the ability to rapidly deploy, and control over versions and version distribution.
                        <code>docker run hello-world
                        </code>

                    <p>
                        Although sometimes confused, Docker is not the same as a traditional Linux container. Docker technology was initially built on top of the LXC technology—which most people associate with "traditional" Linux containers—though it’s since moved away from that dependency. 
                        LXC was useful as lightweight virtualization, but it didn’t have a great developer or user experience. 
                        The Docker technology brings more than the ability to run containers—it also eases the process of creating and building containers, shipping images, and versioning of images, among other things. Traditional Linux containers use an init system that can manage multiple processes. 
                        This means entire applications can run as one. 
                        The Docker technology encourages applications to be broken down into their separate processes and provides the tools to do that. This granular approach has its advantages.
